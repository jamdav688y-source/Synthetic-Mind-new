# Incident Artifact Schema (Markdown)

Incidents are not about punishment.
They are about **system correction**.

An Incident is valid only if it includes every required field below.

---

## Required Fields

### 1) Incident ID
- Format: `INC-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>`
- Example: `INC-2026-01-29-ungoverned-execution`

### 2) Title
Short description of what happened.

### 3) Severity
One of:
- Sev-0 (near miss)
- Sev-1 (minor)
- Sev-2 (major)
- Sev-3 (critical)

### 4) Owner
Single accountable human for the fix + institutional change.

### 5) What Happened
Plain language summary.

### 6) Impact
Who/what was affected (time, money, trust, safety, ops).

### 7) Root Cause Category
Choose one:
- Missing gate
- Missing ownership
- Missing rollback
- Bad assumptions
- Tool failure
- Model failure / hallucination
- Data / retrieval failure
- Human workflow failure
- Policy bypass (explicit or implicit)

### 8) Which Control Failed
Name the missing/failed control-plane primitive:
- Decision memory
- Stop authority
- Auditability
- Reversibility
- Permissioned execution
- Other (define)

### 9) Linked Decision(s)
Every serious incident must map to one or more Decisions.

If you cannot link an Incident to a Decision, it indicates:
- ungoverned execution
- invisible authority
- a control-plane bypass

All are unacceptable.

### 10) Corrective Action
The direct fix.

### 11) Institutional Change
What governance changes permanently:
- new gate
- new rule
- new stop condition
- new review threshold
- new monitoring signal

### 12) Prevention Test
How you verify this won’t repeat (what check proves it).
