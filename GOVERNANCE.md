# Governance Doctrine

This repository operates under explicit authority, ownership, and stop
conditions. Work progresses only when responsibility and control are aligned.

This document defines how decisions are made, how risk is owned, and when work
stops.

---

## 1. Core Principle

> Responsibility must never increase faster than authority.

Any process, request, or contribution that violates this principle will slow
down or stop by default.

---

## 2. Work Classification

All work in this repository falls into one of two categories:

### A. Decision-Bearing Work
Work that can:
- Affect users, systems, or data
- Introduce irreversible or costly changes
- Create follow-on obligations

Decision-bearing work **requires explicit ownership**.

### B. Exploratory Work
Work intended to:
- Learn
- Evaluate options
- Reduce uncertainty

Exploratory work must still declare:
- Who closes the exploration
- What outcome ends it

Exploration without a closure condition is considered entropy.

---

## 3. Ownership Requirements

Every issue or pull request that progresses beyond discussion must declare:

- **Decision Owner**  
  The person authorized to make the final call.

- **Downside Owner**  
  The person accountable if the outcome fails.

- **Stop Condition**  
  The condition under which work halts, rolls back, or is reconsidered.

If any of these are missing or ambiguous, progress pauses automatically.

---

## 4. Authority and Review

Reviews signal legitimacy, not urgency.

A review request does **not** imply:
- Agreement
- Shared ownership
- Transfer of responsibility

Reviewers may:
- Slow review when authority is unclear
- Decline review when downside ownership is undefined
- Request clarification before engaging

This is normal operation.

---

## 5. Mentions and Participation

Mentions are treated as signals, not assignments.

A mention does not create obligation unless accompanied by:
- Explicit ownership
- Clear authority
- Defined scope

Pressure without ownership is informational only.

---

## 6. Entropy Management

The repository tracks entropy by observing:

- Rate of issue creation vs. resolution
- Volume of unowned or undecided work
- Repeated reopening without authority change

Rising entropy without ownership correction is a governance failure, not a
productivity issue.

Entropy is addressed structurally, not heroically.

---

## 7. Default Behaviors

When ambiguity exists:

- Tempo slows
- Clarification is requested once
- Silence is treated as lack of authority
- Work remains paused

When authority and ownership are clear:

- Execution proceeds without unnecessary coordination
- Reviews focus on correctness, not politics
- Decisions are recorded, not relitigated

---

## 8. Exit Conditions

Disengagement is appropriate when:

- Responsibility expands while authority remains abstract
- Stop conditions are deferred indefinitely
- Ownership is repeatedly reassigned or diluted

Exit may occur quietly and without justification.

This preserves system integrity.

---

## 9. Enforcement

This doctrine is enforced through:
- Issue and PR structure
- Review pacing
- Participation boundaries
- Consistent behavior

No escalation, consensus-building, or persuasion is required.

---

## 10. Final Note

This repository prioritizes governability over throughput.

Speed is valuable only when reversibility and authority are intact.
